# Privacy policy

This privacy policy covers iOS applications (“apps”) developed by me, Sebastian
Staudt.

#### What information is collected and how is it used

The apps do not collect any personal information and no registration or account
is required to use them.

The apps do collect anonymous device and usage data which includes the device
model and iOS version and time of usage. This is used to provide basic analysis
of the apps‘ usage, e.g. which iOS versions are used.

Additionally, the apps may gather information during application crashes. The
collected information is used to improve the apps, i.e. fixing those crashes.

No further analytics data, e.g. user interactions, is collected or used.

#### Changes to this policy

I reserve the right to change this policy at any time. It is recommended to
check this site regularly referring to the date of the last change below.
